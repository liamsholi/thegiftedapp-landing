# Welcome to Gifted

We're thrilled to announce **Gifted** - a revolutionary new app that's about to change the way you think about gift-giving.

## The Problem We're Solving

Let's be honest: finding the perfect gift is stressful. You spend hours scrolling through endless product pages, reading reviews, comparing prices, and still end up second-guessing your choice. Sound familiar?

We've all been there:
- Panic-buying something last minute
- Giving yet another generic gift card
- Forgetting important dates until it's too late
- Struggling to find something unique and meaningful

## Our Solution

Gifted takes the stress out of gift-giving by making discovery fun and intuitive. Think of it like Tinder, but for gifts.

### How It Works

1. **Swipe Right** - Save gifts you love to your wishlist
2. **Swipe Left** - Skip items that aren't quite right
3. **Swipe Up** - See full details, images, and reviews

It's that simple. No more endless scrolling. No more decision fatigue.

## What Makes Us Different

### Curated Quality
We partner with top UK retailers to bring you high-quality, unique gift ideas - not random products from questionable sellers.

### Smart Wishlists
Organise gifts by person, occasion, or budget. Set date reminders so you never forget an important gift again.

### Share & Collaborate
Share wishlists with family and friends. Coordinate group gifts without spoiling the surprise.

## Coming Soon

We're working hard to bring Gifted to iOS and Android. Join our waitlist to be the first to know when we launch!
